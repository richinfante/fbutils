# Framebuffer Graphics
**This is a modified version of a really old project I build back in high school. I'm still in progress of making it more modern and fast, and at the moment, it compiles, but is most likely very buggy**

At it's heart, this project aims to allow programs running on a small device such as a raspberry pi to be able to draw graphics using a simple API and without needing the X window system.
